							<br><br>
								<p> Max, who lives in Cairns North Queensland, is a 25 year old student of RMIT.
									 	He has previously studied a diploma at CQU and worked in the ADF.
									 	His interest in IT started because of his father, who was an IT consultant working from home.
									 	Hence Max was always surrounded by computers and servers.
									 	Knowledge and interest in IT was accelerated during work in the ADF.</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “… every second week there was something new;... radios, GPS, commanders tablets,
									 	tracking and positioning gadgets, bore-sight tools were becoming more common place,
									 	everything was starting to become more ‘digital.’” </p>

								<p>	After the Army, Max decided to study IT. He was drawn towards Information security and started some online courses,
									 	such as Comtia Network and linux+ offered at sites such as <a href="Cybrary.it">Cybrary.it</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a>
										 and <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>

									 	With these courses Max started to become more interested in programming,
									 	and started taking some courses in learning how to code using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">CodeAcademy</a>. </p>

								<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “RMIT has a lot more programming on offer. In particular linux and C++ … [and these] were good selling points…
									 	but I also hope to improve my GUI and graphical design...” <p>

							Studying accountancy at night, in 1979 he became a member of what is now known as the
							Institute of Public Accountants.
							The following year he started an undergraduate Mathematics degree at Flinders University. <br>
							Whilst working as an accountant, Lewis was exposed to computer programming and from then on programming became somewhat of a passion.
							This passion became the driver to enrol in the RMIT IT Degree. <br>
							Asked what it is about computer programming he likes, he stated: </p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “… personal satisfaction. It gives me immense joy when presented with a
							programming problem and I ‘nut’ it out, and make things work.” </p>
							Other than family, his biggest love is his home town football club: Swindon Town Football Club (Nicknamed
							‘The Robins’ because of their red shirts).
							Lewis has been married for over 40 years and has one child.</p>

		<u><h1 style="text-align:center"> Group processes</h1></u>
		<p>  Team “Quik Biz” has kept the same communication process going for Assignment 3 as we did for Assignment 2.
			   We believe this to be the most efficiency process. Our groups primary technique for communicating was our
				 scheduled biweekly meetings hosted in Microsoft Teams (MT).</p> <br>
		<p>	 During the first meeting of our group back in Assignment 2, all the team members agreed we would have at
				 least two meetings per week, usually on a Monday and Thursday. Of all the meetings in both Assignment 2 and 3
				 there have only been 2 apologies, which is a sign of our positive commitment to the project and our processes.
				 Whilst there have been informal communication between team members this has always been conducted within MT,
				 and this correspondence is freely viewable to all team members. MT streamlined the communication process.
				 Written work was also shared within the MT platform. This work was then uploaded into GitHub or incorporated
				 into the PDF file(s) in the appropriate format. Assembling the teams written work into this one central
				 location allowed all team members to communicate their concerns/comments. </p><br>
		<p>	 The above processes also allowed our group leader, Lewis, to more easily delegate tasks between the group.
				 This made his leadership role much more time efficient. We discussed our strengths and weaknesses in our
				 meetings and made sure everyone was comfortable with the tasks they were asked to do.</p><br>

								<h3>Ideal Jobs Summary:</h3>
								<p>Most of the team are unsure of the industry they prefer,  Most of the preferred jobs are your
									 traditional employer/employee relationships in a fixed office environment. However two jobs
									 are best described as freelance, sub-contractor or franchise type employment where work is in
									 multiple locations and the team member remains his own boss.</p>

							<h3>Skills Summary</h3>
							<p>As can be seen from the above table, all the ideal jobs insist on a number of core skills.
								 The most prominent being communication and the ability to work in teams.
								 Although one job does require working in teams plus the ability to work independently.

								<blockquote cite="http://autismworkbarrier.org.uk/articles/good-communication-skills">
									56% of jobs requires good communication and interpersonal skills while 33% require
									‘excellent communication skills’  <a href="http://autismworkbarrier.org.uk/articles/good-communication-skills">[Source]</a>
								</blockquote>

								After this, the jobs tend to specialise. Most require programming skills, one predominantly
								requires system testing abilities and one centres around in-home customer support.</p>
						<h3>Education Requirements</h3>
						<p>We believe an undergraduate degree is a ‘minimum’ for all the preferred positions.
							 One position however, insists on a Masters Degree.</p>

						<h2>Career Paths</h2>

						<p>With the teams preferred jobs not changing from Assignment 1 and 2, all team members see
							 no reason to change their career paths from those discussed in Assignment 2. They are:</p>

						<table style="width:100%">

								He aims to identify a niche, through his volunteer work, through Alfred Health,
								in Melbourne.<br>

								He completed a year of as an electrical apprenticeship so has a lot of
								knowledge regarding installing data points and racks, essential for home support.
								He plans to complete his IT degree and continue his own research into home
								electronics, and do small jobs for friends. </td>
						<tr>
							<td>Max Trounce</td>
							<td>Max will need to finish his bachelors here at RMIT.
								Upon completion he wants to do Honours in software engineering likely at a
								different University as he is unsure if RMIT has this option,
								although he is aware that QUT does.
								After Honours he would then either attempt to enter the workforce as a
								junior software engineer in order to gain some hands on and real-life
								experience that he needs to acquire before applying for the ideal job,
								or he may commence a master’s the year after. Considering the job,
								an Honours and Masters Degree in either software development,
								cyber security, or artificial intelligence would likely be his best course of action.
								This pathway so far is likely to take at least 6 years of uninterrupted
								full-time study provided that all units are passed and completed on time. </td>
						</tr>
						</table>
						<h3>Career Paths Summary</h3>
						<p> Initially all team members wish to complete their undergraduate degree. After this they
							  plan different strategies. These range from no further studies to completing an Honours
								degree and a Masters degrees. All but one of the team see a need for some form of further
								study after the undergraduate degree.</p>

								</tr>

									<td>Lewis Dean</td>
									<td>Lewis would like to thank Mark, Peter, Lucky, Zac and Max for being a great bunch to work with.
										  He wishes them all the best for their future careers.<br>
									<u>	What went well:</u> <br>
    								  • Process. Whilst all team members wrote different aspects of the project it was important that when
											these were combined it came together into one coherent article. Given the risks of this approach,
											Lewis felt this was the teams best achievement.<br>
            				  • Output. Lewis felt the quality of our output was exemplary.<br>
									<u>	What could be improved:</u><br>
											On a personal level, Lewis thought his leadership performance could have been better. He missed the
											due date of Assignment 5 (Video Submission) which put undue pressure and stress on all team members
											in delivering Assignments 3 and 5 on the same day. As a consequence, the team missed the submission
											date for the storyboard.<br>
									<u>	What was surprising:</u><br>
											(same as A2) Lewis had a ‘misplaced’ perception of the maturity and ability of the younger generation.
											But all the team members surprised him with their confidence, maturity and ability. He considers
											their command of IT (especially Apps) is mind boggling. <br>
									<u>	What have I learned about Groups:</u><br>
											(same as A2) Lewis felt it’s difficult to say to one of the group that you think their efforts can be
											improved (English expression etc.). How do you tell them? Choice of words are so very important.
											You have to be aware of their sensitivities. This can be difficult in a team that is still trying to get
											to know one another. Fortunately, he felt all members of our team reacted positively to suggestions.
											But he felt the corollary is a bigger issue – to shy away from telling them, either by leaving work unchanged
											or not telling them of the change. Either way Lewis felt that shying away causes more issues than being honest
											up front. Lewis concluded <br>
   									  "...it all comes down to the main issue that permeates the whole of this I.T. course. Namely:
											<br>Communication / Communication / Communication”

			</ul>

	<!--		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Mark Parisotto was born in Sydney and comes from an Italian background, as such he is capable of speaking some Italian.
			Mark lived in Sydney for his early life until after he had completed his first 5 years of schooling,
			before he moved to the Griffith region of NSW where he remained for the duration of his schooling experience.
			Mark has worked at a number of petrol stations as a customer attendant and is currently employed as a health information officer at a private hospital in Melbourne.
			He has thoroughly enjoyed his career so far however,
			he believes his true passion lies within the realm of Information technology which is why he has decided to pursue his studies here at RMIT.
		<br><br>His hobbies include gaming, ball sports (particularly Rugby and Soccer), Music (Rock and Metal) and fixing cars.</a>.</p>
-->
			<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
		<p>Mark has always had a strong interest in IT, starting at a young age when he used to play flash games on his parents computer.
		 Over the years his fascination grew leading him to take IT electives whilst in highschool which led him to study a diploma of IT once he graduated.
		 Marks Interest in IT is centered heavily around Information security and programming with an expressed interest in programming of intelligent systems. </p>

		  <h2>Personality Type</h2>

		  <div class = "teamImg2">
	<img src="images/Mark-Test.png" alt="" />

		</div>
	<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p> Mark is a Mediator and a tactile learner, the mediator personality is indicative of people who may seem quiet
				or unassuming at first although they often have vibrant private and social lives.
				Idealistic and their natural care for others leads them to pursue deep meaningful relationships and they are
				always happy to help others in need. Mediators can often feel as if their lives are lacking in direction and
				purpose, for many this purpose lies within the realm of assisting others while they are aware that the world
				will never be perfect, however they still care in assisting to make it a little better.</p>
			<br>

			<p>As a tactile learner Mark learns in a “hands on” way, preferring to touch, build, draw or otherwise act out
				 what the skills are he is attempting to learn. It is recommended that he is active and take frequent breaks,
				 tactile learners are more likely to use their hands and make gestures when speaking and can have difficulty in
				 remaining seated for extended periods of time, hence why it is recommended for them to take regular breaks. </p>
			<br>
			<h2>Test Result Reflection</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The results of the tests mean a fair bit to mark, he states that they are always a good indicator of what your
				 true personality is. In particular the Myers-Briggs test really goes into detail about how your personality
				 affects your day to day life and gives a good insight into personality traits which he did not know he had.
				 Because of this reason, mark believes that everyone can benefit by taking one or more of these tests in order
				 to potentially learn something new about themselves as long as they are honest about their answers to the
				 questions on the test. <br>
				 Mark believes that the personality traits he posses and the traits that have been reflected in his test results
				 allow him to work well within a team, the personality type: Mediator, is an integral part of any team as they
				 are able to assist in peacefully and fairly resolving conflicts when they arise. As a Mediator mark believes
				 that he is capable of forming and taking opinions from both sides and will be able to effectively keep
				 everybody on track with their tasks.</p>

	<p>Max, who lives in Cairns North Queensland, is a 25 year old student of RMIT. He has previously studied a diploma at CQU and worked in the ADF.
		His interest in IT started because of his father, who was an IT consultant working from home. Hence Max was always surrounded by computers and servers.
		Knowledge and interest in IT was accelerated during work in the ADF.
		<br><br>His hobbies include: working out, gaming and programming.</p>
		<br>
-->
	 <h2>Intrest in IT </h2>
	 <p>Max has had an Interest in IT since he was quite young, his dad worked as an It consultant so he grew up in an
			 environment where he was exposed to a number of different systems from an early age. His curiosity grew until
			 he joined the army in 2012 where he was exposed to the full scope of what encompasses the umbrella term of “IT”
			 having to learn and become proficient in utilising new radios, gps and other military technologies his interest
			 peaked and he decided to leave the ADF and pursue a career in Information Technology </p>

	 <h2>Personality Type</h2>

	 <p>Max is a Logician and a visual learner. Logicians are people who love patterns and technology.
		  Often they have abstract ideas,which can seem counter-intuitive at first glance however generally these ideas
			prove to be remarkable innovations, Logicians can often become so caught up in their own train of thought that
			they can forget to consider the emotional side of things, this is often perceived as a lack of sympathy and is
			often attributed to them being considered inconsiderate by their peers. Max agrees that often he can become
			caught up in his own thoughts so much that he over analyses the problem and can miss the point entirely.</p>

			</div>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


		<p>As a visual learner Max is more prone to learning quicker if the information or tasks required are presented in a written or picture form, instead of verbal, or hands on.
			Visual learners learn quicker when they create their own diagrams and pictures to explain or represent the information.
			They should try to study or learn in an environment that is free from visual distractions and should use different fonts,
			styles and colors for different meanings when studying and taking notes.</p>
<br>
<h2>Test Result Reflection</h2>
<p>Max agrees with the results of his tests for the most part, however he has stated that he is unaware of any other personality types.
	After reviewing his results from the tests max believes that his traits are not Ideal for working in a team his introverted personality and constant overthinking are likely to hinder
	his performance and make him unlikely to present his ideas to the group. Max states he has difficulty explaining and articulating his ideas and opinions and can become easily frustrated when
	 others do not understand his ideas. Max disagreed with some of the personality traits he was given with his results, in his opinion he is not necessarily very creative, and says he has difficulty
	 in coming up with ideas for stories and has terrible graphical skills (such as drawing). Max also considers himself more of a practical learner instead of a visual, believing he will only ever truly
	  learn how to do something once he has gone through the motions many times.</p>

<!--
		<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Lewis was born in England and immigrated to Australia when he was 11, he was particularly gifted in mathematics during his schooling and represented his schools in soccer and chess.
		Lewis studied accounting at night and became a member of the Institute of public Accountants in 1979, the following year he started his undergraduate degree in mathematics at Flinders University.
		 Whilst working as an accountant Lewis was exposed to Programming which he thoroughly enjoyed and evolved into a hobby during his free time.
		  This hobby is what led Lewis to study a bachelors of IT through RMIT.
		Lewis enjoys programming, and supporting his towns football team, (Swindon) nicknamed “The Robins”.
		 </p>
-->
		<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
		<p> Lewis gained an interest in IT when he started working as an accountant in the finance department of ZZZ.
			He was the first person at his workplace to learn the macro programming ability of 123 and Excel (VBA).
			 His workplace skills quickly became a beloved hobby and he started to teach himself how to write other programs and use breadboards such as the Adruino and the Raspberry Pi,
			 eventually Lewis decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree which led him to RMIT.</p>

		  <h2>Personality Type</h2>
		  <p>Lewis is an Adventurer and a Tactile learner. The explorer personality trait is indicative of those who are Observant,
			   feeling and Prospective in nature, they are true artists at their core but generally in an unconventional way they gain pleasure in pushing the limits of social norms and conventions.
			    Adventurers live in a world inspired by connections with people and take joy in reinterpreting these connections by experimenting with them and considering new perspective,
				 this combines with their natural spontaneity, often makes them seem unpredictable even to those who have close personal relationships with them.
<br><br>
<br>
		<div class = "teamImg2">
			<img src="images/Lewis-test.svg" alt="" /></div>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			As another tactile learner of the group Lewis learns best by taking a practical and methodological approach to learning,
			 the need to go through the motions, make errors and then learn from them is an integral part of learning for the tactile learner.
			 Lewis finds that in long lectures and reading material he can “switch” off and is more of less watching rather than doing anything stating he “learns best by doing”.
			</p>

<br>
<h2>Test Result Reflection</h2>
<br>
<p>Lewis believes that the results of his tests are somewhat accurate, he agrees he has an adventurous nature and is observant and prospective,
	and In his younger years he was quite outgoing, contradicting one of the perceptions from the Briggs-Myers test stating that adventures are Introverted people.
	However this appears to be the only discrepancy with the tests Lewis took, he also completed an IQ test and received a score of 105-120 putting him above the national
	average of 99.2. Lewis states that his test results state or indicate that he should not be a leader however he states that his most enjoyable and productive time at ZZZ
	was when he was managing the finance IT team, sometimes the test results miss certain things and others a person who undertakes the test may have results that are very
	close to putting them within a different classification and this may be the case for lewis.</p>
